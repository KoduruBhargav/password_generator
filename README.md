I designed a password generator using Python. I included a list of alphabets, a set of numbers, and symbols that are usually accepted by websites. 
Nowadays, many security issues arise from using the same password for different websites. So, I created a password generator to enhance security and reduce these risks.
The output I provided was just an example of what might be printed when you run the code, but it's not guaranteed to be exactly the same every time because it depends on the random selections.
